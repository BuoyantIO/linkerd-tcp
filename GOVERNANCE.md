# Linkerd-TCP Governance

Governance of Linkerd-TCP follows the same rules as that of Linkerd itself.
These rules are described in Linkerd's GOVERNANCE.md, e.g. at https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md.

However, the set of maintainers is different, and is defined by the contents of
the MAINTAINERS.md file in this repo.
